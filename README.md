1. clone this repository to your local machine
1. open the directory you cloned in vscode

1. complete the `TODO`s and `FIXME`s in the `index.html` file
1. Once you're happy with your progress, use FileZilla to deploy this directory to w3stu such the index.html file you've completed is available at: https://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/YOUREID/cs343/hello
1. Does the page look the same as it looks when running on your local computer? If not, why not? What can you do to fix it? 
THe first thing that I notice is that the video do not display correctly when running them through live server. The other difference is the position of the videos move from a row layout on live server to a column layout on stu. We could fix it by using a more robust style sheet and something like a flexbox layout
1. Use git to stage your changes, commit your changes, and push your changes to your remote repository.
1. Tell your repository to deploy to github pages (see the screenshot and caption below it in the `figure` in `index.html`)
1. Does the page look the same as it looks when running on your local computer? If not, why not? What can you do to fix it?
